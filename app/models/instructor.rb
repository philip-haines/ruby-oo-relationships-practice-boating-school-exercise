# `Instructor` class:
# * initialize with a name
# * `Instructor.all` should return all instructors
# * `Instructor#passed_students` should return an array of students who passed a boating test with this specific instructor.
# * `Instructor#pass_student` should take in a student instance and test name. If there is a `BoatingTest` whose name and student match the values passed in, this method should update the status of that BoatingTest to 'passed'. If there is no matching test, this method should create a test with the student, that boat test name, and the status 'passed'. Either way, it should return the `BoatingTest` instance.
# * `Instructor#fail_student` should take in a student instance and test name. Like `#pass_student`, it should try to find a matching `BoatingTest` and update its status to 'failed'. If it cannot find an existing `BoatingTest`, it should create one with the name, the matching student, and the status 'failed'.
# * `Instructor#all_students` should return an array of students who took a boating test with this specific instructor.
